<h3>Information about Number Guessing Game</h3>
<p>To play a number guessing game in the C language, you can start by defining the rules and structure of the game. First, generate a random number within a specified range using the `rand()` function and seed it with `srand(time(NULL))` to ensure randomness. Prompt the player to guess the number and use a loop, such as a `while` loop, to repeatedly ask for guesses until the correct number is guessed. Provide feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low. Keep track of the number of attempts with a counter variable. Once the player guesses the correct number, display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to win. You can also allow the player to play again or exit the game. Properly handling user input, error checks, and displaying instructions will enhance the user experience in your C language number guessing game.</p>
